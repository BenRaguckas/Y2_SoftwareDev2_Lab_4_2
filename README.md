# SoftwareDev2 Lab 4 v2

1. Read in from last weeks text file and print out every 5th word.

2. Create an array of 5 files (do not hard code), put one fifth of the words from the text file in each file (You may need to reuse the method for string/file details you created last week).

3. Randomly swap the contents of all files,( eg file1 now contains the contents of file3 ....), finally printing the statistics for each of the files
